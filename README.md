### Comments

I was given 96h on the 23rd of December to do this.
I was travelling on the 23rd and obviously am busy 25/26 - so I could only give this a day.
Additionally I've been on my laptop without my device integrations so i've mostly been targetting web for test while otherwise continuing my normal practise.

Offline storage for all dates which are invalidatd after one week.
If you pull to refresh (or button on web) it will invalidate the cache.

Editted holidays will be over written on canche invalidation currently.
